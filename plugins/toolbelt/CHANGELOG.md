# Changelog

All notable changes to the `toolbelt` plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- `adversarial-plan-review` skill — destructive, diagnosis-only pre-flight review of an
  implementation plan, designed to sit between Superpowers' `writing-plans` and
  `subagent-driven-development`. Runs as a dispatched subagent in a fresh context with only the
  plan and spec paths as input (context starvation keeps it adversarial, not sympathetic). Applies
  three priority-ordered attack angles — Structural, Operational, Scope — and emits a severity-
  tagged findings table plus a binary verdict (`PASS` / `NEEDS REWORK` / `NEEDS HUMAN`). No
  remediation, no rewrites, findings capped at 20. One-pass-per-session rule enforced at two
  levels (main agent in `SKILL.md`, reviewer in verdict rules) so the skill cannot drift into a
  constructive-reviewer loop. Ships with `review-prompt.md` (verbatim reviewer prompt) and a
  `README.md` containing the ready-to-paste CLAUDE.md routing block.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- `deep-research`, `gh-create-issue`, `gh-fix-pr-review`: add
  `disable-model-invocation: true` — these skills all have side effects or spend significant
  tokens (200K-700K for research, GitHub mutations for the two `gh-*` skills), so Claude no longer
  auto-loads them. Invoke explicitly via `/deep-research`, `/gh-create-issue`,
  `/gh-fix-pr-review`.
- `gh-create-issue`: add `allowed-tools: Bash(gh:*) Read Write WebFetch` and
  `argument-hint: "[title-or-plan-text]"` — pre-approves the `gh` CLI calls the skill makes and
  improves autocomplete.
- `deep-research`: switch `allowed-tools` to the space-separated form documented in the Claude
  Code Skills reference.

### Added

- `code-audit` skill — read-only deep audit of a repository or subtree producing a severity-ranked
  Markdown report (`audit-<slug>-<YYYYMMDD>.md`) at the repo root. Trail-of-Bits-style findings
  (Severity × Difficulty, short/long-term recommendations, effort estimate). Six dimensions in NFR
  priority order: security (OWASP Top 10:2025 RC, ASVS v5) → resilience → cost efficiency →
  architecture & coupling → documentation freshness → monitoring gaps. Never modifies the audited
  project — the only write is the report. Falls back to ripgrep heuristics when scanners
  (`gitleaks`, `trivy`, `semgrep`, `osv-scanner`, `infracost`, `checkov`) are absent. Five
  on-demand reference files (security/resilience/cost/docs+monitoring checklists, report
  template). `disable-model-invocation: true` — fires only on explicit `/code-audit` invocation.
  Optional flag: `--scope=security|resilience|cost|architecture|docs|monitoring|all`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `deep-research` skill — multi-agent orchestrator producing long-form narrative research reports
  (3000-8000 words) grounded in the local codebase and the current web. 7-phase workflow:
  planner → codebase reconnaissance → user-approved outline → parallel web workers (3-5, hard cap
  20) → single-agent synthesis → citation attribution → validation. Output written to
  `./research/{date}-{slug}-report.md` on disk, not chat.
- Five plugin subagents backing the skill: `research-planner`, `code-reconnaissance`,
  `research-worker`, `research-synthesizer`, `citation-agent`.
- Validation scripts: `validate_report.py` (structure, word count, anti-plan-mode discipline),
  `verify_citations.py` (URL liveness + DOI resolution).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `gh-fix-pr-review` skill — fix Claude Code Action review feedback on the current PR. Inspects
  both inline review threads and PR issue comments, picks the highest severity unaddressed issue
  by default, implements and verifies the fix, then commits and replies on the review.
  Flags: `--all`, `--skip-tests`, `--inline`, `--comments`, `--resolve`, `--dry-run`,
  `--pr <number>`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `gh-create-issue` skill — produce well-defined GitHub issues (single, epic, or sub-issues)
  with label discovery and a TDD plan for implementation-ready issues.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Initial plugin scaffold. No skills yet.
